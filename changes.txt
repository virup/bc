1.1 Modified calculateMapLength to use Archon's initial coordinates.
   if init_x > init_y, then move Archon to the East, calculate the distance
   shifted once the archon can't move any further (this assumes it hits the 
   map edge) and add it to init_x to calculate the map side length.
   else move north. 

***What I am trying to do ?***

1. Calculate the field size
2. Hire and move gardeners to particular locations on the map
3. Plant trees in simple configuration (a horizontal line)
4. Water those trees (probably using a second gardener?)
