1.1 Modified calculateMapLength to use Archon's initial coordinates.
   if init_x > init_y, then move Archon to the East, calculate the distance
   shifted once the archon can't move any further (this assumes it hits the 
   map edge) and add it to init_x to caculate the map side length.
   else move north. 

1. checking what info can be retrieved using archon's position
- commented out all other code. only archon will move for my player.
- printing out stuff using println method
- Archon getting stuck...does tryMove really work even if called with 30 deg, 12?
static boolean tryMove(Direction dir, float degreeOffset, int checksPerSide) throws GameActionException {
